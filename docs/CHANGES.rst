Changelog
=========

2.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Rename all control-panel views from the ``@@plone_ldap*`` prefix
  to ``@@senaite_ldap*``. Existing 1.x or early-2.x configlets are
  rewritten by upgrade step 2000 → 2010.
- Object-class fields in the Users and Groups tabs are now
  multi-select pickers populated by sampling the live directory
  (``@@senaite_ldapdiscover_objectclasses``). The underlying
  newline-joined textarea stays available behind an *edit raw*
  link.
- New live filter preview under each tab showing the LDAP filter
  the configured object classes + query filter will produce.
- New discovery endpoint ``@@senaite_ldapdiscover_groups`` returning
  groups under the Groups base DN.
- *Detect* button next to both Users and Groups Base DN fields:
  reads the LDAP server's rootDSE ``namingContexts`` and prefills
  the field. New endpoint
  ``@@senaite_ldapdiscover_naming_contexts``.
- Auto-derive Groups Base DN from Users Base DN on blur: if Users
  base is ``ou=people,…``, suggest ``ou=groups,…`` for Groups when
  empty.
- Groups multi-select picker on the Users tab. Populates the
  ``memberOfExternalGroupDNs`` list by picking from the actual
  groups under the Groups Base DN instead of typing DNs by hand.

2.x replaces the YAFOWIL-based LDAP control panel with a native
SENAITE form. The ``pas.plugins.ldap.plonecontrolpanel`` sub-package
and its profile are no longer installed; our ZCML no longer pulls in
any YAFOWIL code. The YAFOWIL eggs themselves stay on disk because
``pas.plugins.ldap`` still declares them as runtime dependencies in
its egg metadata — they are present but unused. Existing ``pasldap``
plugin configuration in the ZODB is untouched. See
``docs/2.x-plan.md`` for the full plan and follow-up work to drop the
disk footprint as well.

- Bump profile version to 2000, drop the
  ``pas.plugins.ldap.plonecontrolpanel`` profile dependency.
- Replace the YAFOWIL control panel with a native SENAITE form.
- Upgrade step 1100 → 2000 cleans up orphan YAFOWIL registry records
  on existing 1.x installs and re-imports the controlpanel profile.
- Add unit tests for the control panel form helpers.
- Add a live LDAP search / inspector page at
  ``@@plone_ldapsearch``, linked from the control-panel status
  header. Browse the directory by Users / Groups / custom base DN,
  run arbitrary RFC 4515 filters, click a result to expand its
  full attribute set. Replaces the ``@@plone_ldapinspector`` view
  from the dropped ``plonecontrolpanel`` sub-package.
